\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Functions}, {\itshape variables} and {\itshape filenames} must be written in {\ttfamily snake\+\_\+case}.
\item {\itshape Structures} must be written in {\ttfamily Pascal\+Case}.
\item {\itshape Constants} or {\itshape M\+A\+C\+RO} must be written in {\ttfamily U\+P\+P\+E\+R\+\_\+\+S\+N\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+C\+A\+SE}.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{Tests}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
Each function must be tested before {\bfseries{marked as done}}. To create a test function, you must write it in the {\ttfamily test/} directory and call the file {\ttfamily filename\+\_\+test.\+c} and its functions {\ttfamily functionname\+\_\+test}. Note that the test file must be at the same relative place than his real function

exemple \+: if you want to test {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{server_8h_ad7de155004abd1b0a8577003348ba464}{init\+\_\+server()}}} in the file {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{network_2client_8c}{network/client.\+c}}}, you must write the test in {\ttfamily test/network/client\+\_\+test.\+c} and call the test function {\ttfamily init\+\_\+server\+\_\+test()}
